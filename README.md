A Python library for face detection using YOLOv8. This library enables real-time face detection via webcam, leveraging the YOLOv8 model for high-performance object detection.

## Features

- Real-time face detection with YOLOv8
- Easy integration with webcam
- Customizable detection thresholds and labels

## Installation

You can install the library via pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install face_detection_lib
```

## Usage

To use the `face_detection_lib` library for face detection, follow these steps:

### Basic Usage

```python
from face_detection_lib.detector import FaceDetector

# Initialize the FaceDetector
detector = FaceDetector()

# Start the webcam and run face detection
detector.run_webcam()
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the face detection by passing parameters to the `FaceDetector` class. For example, you can set a custom model path, labels, or confidence threshold:

```python
from face_detection_lib.detector import FaceDetector

# Define custom parameters
custom_model_path = 'path/to/your/custom/model.pt'
custom_labels = {0: 'Person A', 1: 'Person B'}
custom_confidence_threshold = 0.7

# Initialize the FaceDetector with custom parameters
detector = FaceDetector(
    model_path=custom_model_path,
    labels=custom_labels,
    confidence_threshold=custom_confidence_threshold
)

# Start the webcam with custom settings
detector.run_webcam()
```

## Testing

Ensure that your library functions as expected by writing tests in the `tests/test_detector.py` file. Here's a basic example of how you might start testing:

```python
def test_face_detection():
    # Initialize the FaceDetector
    detector = FaceDetector()
    
    # Add tests to verify the functionality
    assert detector is not None
    # Further tests can be added here
```

### Running Tests

To run your tests, execute:

```bash
pytest
```

## Build and Upload to PyPI

To publish your library to PyPI, follow these steps:

1. **Install Twine**

   Make sure `twine` is installed:

   ```bash
   pip install twine
   ```

2. **Build the Package**

   Navigate to the root directory of your project and build the package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

3. **Upload to PyPI**

   Use `twine` to upload your package to PyPI:

   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

   Replace `dist/*` with the actual path to your distribution files if necessary.

1. **Build Status Badge**: Replace `yourusername/your-repo` with your GitHub username and repository name. The URL structure may vary depending on your CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI).

2. **License Badge**: Replace `yourusername/your-repo` with your GitHub username and repository name.

3. **PyPI Version Badge**: The `face_detection_lib` in the URL should match the name of your package on PyPI.

### How to Get the Badge URLs

- **Build Status Badge**: The badge URL depends on your CI/CD service. For GitHub Actions, it typically follows this format:
  ```
  https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/yourusername/your-repo/Workflow%20Name
  ```
- **License Badge**: You can use shields.io with your GitHub repo:
  ```
  https://img.shields.io/github/license/yourusername/your-repo
  ```
- **PyPI Version Badge**: This follows the format:
  ```
  https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/your-package-name
  ```

Make sure to replace placeholders with actual values related to your project.
